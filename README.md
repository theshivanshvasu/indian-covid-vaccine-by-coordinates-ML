# Indian COVID Status by Coordinates-ML Project:

It is a small Machine Learning based Project which predicts the COVID Status of Infinite no. of places on the basis of Geographical Coordinates by the means of which the current Covid Status can also be Predicted. It can also be used for Prediction of the number of Total Delivered Delivered Doses along with the he Number of Vaccine Sessions as well as Number of Running Vaccine Sites around the given coordinates. By the same means, One can easily get the COVID Pandemic Status of a Place. This solves the Issue of asking before going anywhere in India. Now anyone can get information of infinite number of Places in by just Coordinates in one click.
